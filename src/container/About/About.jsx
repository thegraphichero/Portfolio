            Hi there, my name is Paramveer singh. Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer and
            Graphic Designer based in Canada. I love Art, Tech, and Deep space
            exploration. Taking care of the smallest details is the key element
            of all my arts & crafts. My work ethics and philosophy both fit the
            <span> "A thousand no's for every yes"</span> mindset. When it comes
            to what I do, I am a strong believer of eclecticism: Finding
            inspiration and resources within a wide range of fields and
            environments is the most essential propellant for my creative
            process as well as for my growth and expansion both as an individual
            and a professional.
          </p>
